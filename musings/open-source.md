title: What is Open Source GIScience?
---



To understand the implications of Open Source GIScience for a course at
Middlebury College, we first need to distinguish between the meanings of free
software, open source and open science. Free software does not necessarily
mean it costs zero dollars, but it allows anyone to use it for any purpose,
to make changes to it, and then to distribute those changes to anyone without
additional cost. Free software is always open source, but open source is not
always free software. Open source is transparent, and is not black box software,
you can see the code under the hood. The original code can be copied and
modified as long as it complies with the original projects license, whether it
be an MIT License or a GNU Public License. Open source is not necessarily
free, however, it just means it is available to the general public. For example,
planet labs makes satellite images available to the general public, but in
order to download or use them, one must pay tens of dollars. Open science aligns
with many of the values of open source, in that it is a movement to make
scientific research more accessible, available and reproduceable. Broadly,
open source GIScience has a vision where academia contributes and
communicates to the larger open source GIS community and also aligns its
publication with values of open source by including code and data.

Aligning our class with Open Source GIScience means we need to consider how
we want to collaborate and share our code. Creating our own kind of license
with tenants discussed among the group could be one way to agree upon our own
values of open source GIScience. For example, although the MIT license requires
use of its code to also follow the guidelines of the MIT license, there are not
rules on providing credit to previous programmers or contributors. Because
Middlebury has requirements for giving students letter grades, which are often
derived in some way from class participation, including rules in our class
where we give credit where credit is due is more in line with how grading at
Middlebury usually works. GitHub makes it easy to add collaborators to code,
or to potentially assign ourselves to any "issues" that we have worked on to
keep track of who has worked on what. In this way, we would be following
the values of the open source GIScience movement, but would also remain in
line with Middlebury College's honor code.

Xun Shi, in his presentation A Bottom-up Approach to Epidemic Modeling: Conceptual Framework, Implementation, and Case Study, argues that bottom up approaches for modeling of epidemics is a better and more accurate way of modeling than a top down approach.

Shi starts his presentation with some helpful context, first comparing the top down approach to modeling, and the bottom up approach to modeling. The top down approach seeks to first establish global/general models, which assumes that local spaces are just subsets of the global model. Other assumptions made by the top down approach limit its accuracy, such as its assumption that controlled experiments are possible. Top down models thus end up relying on unrealistic assumptions, and in order for the model to work globally, they end up becoming very complicated and delicate. Instead, Shi advocates for a bottom up approach. By starting local, the top down approach builds simple rules for local situations and interactions. Then, by doing this for many locales, a global/general pattern emerges. Bottom up models are good at stochastic processes, as well as modeling progression and interactions locally. They are also much less brittle than top down models.

Shi's case study, an epidemic model of COVID-19 uses a bottom up approach. Epidemic models are traditionally top down models, as well as temporal and non-spatial. Shi theorized that a bottom up approach would be a more accurate way of modeling COVID-19. His model was constructed using a 5 step process:
    1. construct individual level trajectories
    2. evaluate individual level contacts
    3. build individual level transmission chains
    4. derive characteristics of epidemics
    5. simulate epidemic scenarios using derived characteristics

Shi's case study found that a bottom up approach to epidemic modeling is possible.
